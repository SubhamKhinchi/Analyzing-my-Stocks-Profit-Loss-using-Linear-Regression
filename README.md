# Analyzing-my-Stocks-Profit-Loss-using-Linear-Regression
In this short project, I'm analyzing my stocks profit loss using Linear Regression. And predicted future Profit Loss against Nifty50, an Indian Stock Market Index. 
I have already created a Google sheet for Profit Loss and Nifty50 data and used gviz, Google Visualization API to query and get data.
